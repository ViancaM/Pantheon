# ✨ Pantheon

A clash of elements, strategy, and risk-taking.
Welcome to Pantheon, a competitive two-player card game where Fire, Water, Earth, and Air each bring their own challenges to the table.
You’ll work to complete challenges, deal with disadvantages, and deal with the occasional Retrograde that can shake up the game.
Pantheon is fast-paced, strategic, and a little unpredictable card-game where every turn matters.

### 🌌 Game Overview
Pantheon is played with 24 zodiac themed cards with their respective elements:
- 🌿 Earth
- 🌬️ Air
- 🔥 Fire
- 💧 Water
  
Each card contains:
- A challenge you must complete
- A disadvantage that affects you if you fail
The first player to complete three cards of the same element wins, but it may not be so easy.

### 🃏 How the Game Works
✨ Game Flow
- Start at the Main Menu, where the journey begins.
- Enter the game board, where both players are dealt randomized, hidden cards.
- Each player begins with three active cards.
  
On your turn, you can:

⭐ Skip

⭐ Forsake/Draw a new card

⭐ Trade one of your cards

⭐ Attempt a Challenge

Retrograde cards may also appear and if they do, all completed cards from both players return to the deck, sending the game into cosmic reset.
